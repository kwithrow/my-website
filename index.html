            <p>Hello! I am currently as an Insurance Agent out of Southeast Missouri. I am married with one daughter, a corgi named Bohkee, and two spunky felines. I decided there was more that I wanted to pursue in life and took a leap of faith and jumped into coding.</p>
            <p>I first started learning code at <a href="https://codecademy.com/">Codecademy.</a> It was a user friendly and cheaper option to see if coding was really a passion of mine, it also helped with teaching me a lot about coding basics but now I am enrolled at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=1783325438&utm_content=75897432663&utm_term=flatiron%20scholarship&uqaid=488305145646&EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE">Flatiron School</a> and I am very excited to learn and to see where this career can take me!</p>
